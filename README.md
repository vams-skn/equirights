## Inspiration

EquiRights was created for the [GNEC Hackathon](https://gnec-hackathon-2025-spring.devpost.com/), with the themes of United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Specifically, [SDG 5](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5) - Gender Equality and [SDG 10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10) - Reduced Inequalities.

Driven by the belief that *knowing your rights is the first step toward exercising them*, I built EquiRights as a platform to assist individuals and activists in understanding the rights of marginalised communities across the globe.
